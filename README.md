This is a repo containing all of my own customizations, personalizations and configurations, These are completely based on my own preferences and beware while applying it to your systems as it may lead to some issues or dissatisfaction, But feel free to use it and customize it as per your own needs. 
This repo is maintained for a soul reason of storing my configs so that when I change my machine or distros I can get back my personalizations.
